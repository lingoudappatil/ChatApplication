Chat app ðŸ’¬ using websockets (Nodejs, Express & Socket.io)-->

We are going to develop a chat application using Express, Websockets. Tough you can use plain websockets but we would be using a library called Socket.io - which is wrapper around Websockets, its super easy to use and provies a fallback to xhr requests until the websocket connection is established.

The frontend-ui is based on Flexbox, no external UI libraries are used, so you can modify it as per your liking.



Technologies Used -->
HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For styling the application.
JavaScript: For handling the application logic.
Socket.io: For real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
Moment.js: For parsing, validating, manipulating, and displaying dates and times.
Font Awesome: For iconography.
